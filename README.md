# Machine-Learning-Specialization

This repositary contains all the code I've used during Coursera Machine Learning specialization. Or at least the things I found usefull.

Specialization is compound of 3 parts:
  1) Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
  2) Advanced Learning Algorithms
  3) Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning
